    <p>
      Most companies in this industry start with equipment.  
      <br>23 Timber Co. started with <strong>a question</strong>:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “What would the woods look like if people managed their land the way the land actually needs to be managed?”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      For years, I watched New England woodlots decline — not from neglect, but from
      misunderstanding.  
      Land that *should’ve* been producing wildlife, timber value, clean water, and 
      generational memory instead became overgrown, unhealthy, or randomly cut without
      strategy.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the same time, I kept having the same conversation with landowners:
      <br>They didn’t want a logging job. They didn’t want a landscaping job.
      <br>They wanted <strong>a plan</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      A plan that respected:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Wildlife habitat</li>
      <li>Timber value and rotation</li>
      <li>Access, trails, and water</li>
      <li>Fire behavior and risk reduction</li>
      <li>The next generation — not just the next 12 months</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      But the industry is split:  
      loggers focus on timber, conservation groups focus on ecology,
      hunters focus on wildlife… rarely do they overlap.  
    </p>

    <p>
      23 Timber Co. exists to sit directly in the middle of all three.

    <h2>Where it really began</h2>

    <p>
      I grew up around land, machinery, and woods that told stories — but I didn’t fully
      appreciate how deep that connection ran until adulthood. Years of reading, 
      working, burning, planting, learning, and observing slowly matured into a single 
      mission:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “Build land plans that outlive their owners.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Not plans that look good on paper.  
      Plans that hold up in storms, droughts, winters, markets, wildlife pressure,
      time, and generations.
    </p>

    <p>
      That’s when it clicked:  
      every acre deserves intentional design — the same way a home, business, or
      legacy does.
    </p>

    <h2>Why “23”?</h2>

    <p>
      More than anything, the name represents:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Returning to the land</li>
      <li>Building something that lasts</li>
      <li>A personal mark for my kids to inherit someday</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      It’s a reminder that the work isn’t just about today — it’s about the 
      generation that follows, and the land they’ll stand on.
    </p>

    <h2>The mission going forward</h2>

    <p>
      23 Timber Co. will always be built around three pillars:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Habitat</strong> — design that supports wildlife</li>
      <li><strong>Timber</strong> — long-term economic value</li>
      <li><strong>Legacy</strong> — something worth passing down</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This company exists because the land deserves better — and because the people
      who own it deserve clarity, confidence, and partnership.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we do our job right, the woods will show it long after we’re gone.
