        <p>
          Whether you just bought your first 10 acres or your family has held
          land for generations, we help you turn “a piece of woods” into a
          working, well-planned property.

          <p>
            A single food plot or a quick cut of timber rarely fixes anything by itself.
            We look at the whole property — access, wind, cover, food, timber, and water —
            and design work that actually moves the needle.

6. About page (with room for your photo/bio)
You said you want a photo + bio of you here. Think: simple, honest, no “corporate” tone.

        <h1>About 23 Timber Co.</h1>
        <p>
          23 Timber Co. exists for people who see their land as more than a
          tax bill or a logging ticket. If you care about wildlife, timber, and
          what your place looks like in 20+ years, you’re in the right spot.
        </p>
        <p>
          The work blends practical forestry, habitat design, and real hunting
          experience on New England ground. The goal is simple: help you make
          better decisions with your acres.

        <h2>About the owner</h2>
        <p>
          I grew up working in the woods, around equipment, and on small farms.
          Today, I split my time between walking land, planning projects, and
          helping owners figure out “what should we actually do first?”
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m not interested in drive-by consulting or selling you projects you
          don’t need. The work is built around realistic budgets, honest trade-offs,
          and plans you can actually execute.
        </p>

(We can tune that bio to be more personal once you tell me how “you” you want it to sound.)
